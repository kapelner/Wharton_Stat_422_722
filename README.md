## Examination

* Final 2/28/17 and 3/1/17 in class (last 120 minutes).

List of topics *not* covered on the final exam:

* Anything about how deep learning works only that it exists and can solve certain types of problems
* Anything about Laplace's demon, determinism, alternative explanations (e.g. quantum theory) for the noise beyond unavailable information
* Calculating likelihoods (but you will need to understand likelihood values given to you and the likelihood ratio test as I will be giving you critiical chi-squared values)
* Sidak and Scheffe corrections to multiple testing (you will only need to know the Bonferroni correction)
* Anything about how the computer numerically maximizes likelihood to find a fit (but you will need to know that this process exists)
* I've decided to leave out equivalence testing (much to my dismay)
* The specifics of D-optimality and I-optimality
* Anything about probit and cloglog link functions
* The Wald test or Score test
* Using the chi-squared with one degree of freedom to product z scores
* All fit metrics of logistic regression except misclassification error, weighted misclassification error and AUC.
* Using expected value of profit matrix
* The interpretation of a single fold's test performance vs. the interpretation of K-fold CV's aggregate oos performance (this was a subtle point)
* K-fold CV for three splits
* Nested K-fold CV for tuning machine learning algorithms
* Backwards and Mixed Stepwise regression (only forward regression is covered)
* Tuning parameters in RF
