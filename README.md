## Examination

* Final 2/28/17 and 3/1/17 in class (last 120 minutes).

List of topics *not* covered on the final exam:

* Calculating likelihoods (but you will need to understand likelihood values given to you and the likelihood ratio test as I will be giving you critiical chi-squared values)
* You will only need to know the Bonferroni correction (Sidak and Scheffe are not covered on the exam)
* Anything about how the computer numerically maximizes likelihood to find a fit (but you will need to know that this process exists)



## Office Hours
